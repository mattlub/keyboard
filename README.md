# Arabic flashcards

An Arabic/English flashcard app to practise vocabulary and practise typing with an arabic keyboard layout.

The app is more of a prototype/proof of concept, and does not currently have a concrete aim.

### Motivation
When learning Arabic, I wanted to practise typing with an Arabic keyboard layout, as getting used to this makes it much easier to practise Arabic over text with friends. The idea was to combine this with a flashcard type learning method. Possibly a better idea would be to separate the keyboard idea, and create an app which teaches basic arabic and typing at the same time, but this requires the content to be created.

### Possible future features
- import cards from a file (e.g. exported from Anki)
- "smart" selection of next card (current implementation is the most basic)

### Code
The app is built with React, but is not super clean since it was put together quickly, purely to test an idea. As such it also lacks testing.

### How to run locally

Clone the repo and navigate to the folder.

```sh
npm install

# start the app
npm start

# or run the tests
npm test
```

### Credit
The style of the keyboard was adapted from [this](https://codepen.io/tholex/pen/rgBcn) codepen.
